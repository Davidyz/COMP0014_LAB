    "# Lab 4: Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second lecture, you learned about different types of agents, and in the previous lab, you played around with simple reflex agents and model-based reflex agents. In the third lecture and in this lab, we discuss goal-based agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a problem where the state space of the problem is well-defined, AND the space of actions that can be taken at each state is well-defined, AND which states correspond to achieving the agent's goal are well-defined, then one simple and flexible method of getting the agent to achieve its goals is through a somewhat \"brute force\" method, which is a search through the state space until a goal state is reached. Having multiple possible actions to take at each state creates a branching structure resembling a tree, where each node *n* at level *l* of the tree represents a state reachable after taking *l* actions. Depending on which action you take at each step, you can end up in a different world (state), and what search methods do is explore these possibilities in order to decide which action to take now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search methods all involve enumerating the possible actions at a particular state (expanding a node), and choosing which node to expand next. You can use search algorithms that stop once they find any viable path to a goal, or you can use others that take into account *path cost* and therefore seek to find the *best* (lowest cost path) to a goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the search algorithm, you can spend more or less time exploring this tree, expanding many nodes, or making educated guesses about which nodes are most likely to get us closer to a goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison of graph search algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "These <a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/people/abisee/gs.pdf\">graph search slides from Stanford</a> are a good overview of some of the graph search algorithms that are out there and how they work.\n",

But as discussed in class, search algorithms can be used to explore more abstract spaces of possibilities, like exploring many options in order to solve puzzles.
